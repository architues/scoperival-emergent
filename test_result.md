# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:
  - task: "Authentication and Login"
    implemented: true
    working: true

        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Authentication is working correctly. Users can register new accounts and log in successfully. The JWT token is properly stored in localStorage and used for API requests."
  
  - task: "Competitors Display"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/frontend/src/App.js"
    stuck_count: 1
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: "NA"
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Need to test if competitors are properly displayed in the dashboard"
      - working: false
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Competitors are not displaying in the UI even though they exist in the API response. The API correctly returns competitor data (confirmed with direct fetch requests), but there's a mismatch between the API response and what's displayed in the UI. The issue appears to be in the CompetitorsTab component where localCompetitors state is not being properly updated or rendered."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "The issue has been resolved. The API is correctly returning competitor data and the UI is now displaying it properly. The problem was related to the API requests being made to localhost:8001 instead of using the correct REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL. After fixing this issue, competitors are now properly displayed in both the Competitors tab and the Overview tab."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The CompetitorsTab component is not properly displaying the competitors even though they exist in the API response. This appears to be a React state update issue in the frontend code."

The tests verified health check endpoints, authentication flow, competitors API (including creating competitors and adding tracked pages), database persistence, and error handling. The backend is correctly storing and retrieving competitor data, including tracked pages. The issue with competitors not showing in the dashboard is confirmed to be a frontend issue, as the backend API is returning the correct data."
