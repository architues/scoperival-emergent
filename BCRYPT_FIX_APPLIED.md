# âœ… FOUND AND FIXED THE ISSUE!

## The Problem
```
passlib.exc.MissingBackendError: bcrypt: no backends available -- recommend you install one (e.g. 'pip install bcrypt')
```

## Root Cause
The `bcrypt` library was missing from `backend/requirements.txt`. The `passlib` library needs `bcrypt` for password hashing but couldn't find it installed.

## Fix Applied
âœ… **Added `bcrypt>=4.0.0`** to `backend/requirements.txt`  
âœ… **Installed locally** to verify it works  

## Deploy the Fix

### 1. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add missing bcrypt dependency for password hashing"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Render will auto-deploy and install bcrypt

### 3. Test Registration
Registration should now work perfectly!

## What Will Happen:
1. âœ… Render installs `bcrypt` during build
2. âœ… `passlib` can use bcrypt backend for password hashing  
3. âœ… Registration endpoint works without 500 error
4. âœ… Users can successfully create accounts

**This was a simple missing dependency issue - very common and easy to fix!** ðŸŽ¯
