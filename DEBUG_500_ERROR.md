# üîç DEEP DEBUG - 500 Error Investigation

## Applied Comprehensive Debugging

### Issues Found & Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ **Fixed datetime.utcnow() calls** - Updated deprecated function calls
2. ‚úÖ **Added comprehensive error logging** - Every step of registration logged
3. ‚úÖ **Made OpenAI setup optional** - Won't crash if API key missing
4. ‚úÖ **Added JWT error handling** - Better error catching for token creation
5. ‚úÖ **Fixed User model datetime field** - Proper lambda function

### Debug Features Added:
- **Step-by-step logging** in registration process
- **Detailed error messages** with traceback
- **Database operation logging** 
- **JWT creation logging**
- **Password hashing logging**

### Deploy and Monitor:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add comprehensive debugging for 500 error investigation"
git push origin main
```

### After Deployment:
1. **Try registration** again
2. **Check Render logs** immediately after failed attempt
3. **Look for specific error** in the detailed logging

### Expected Log Output:
```
Registration attempt for email: test@example.com
Checking if user already exists...
User doesn't exist, creating new user...
Hashing password...
Password hashed successfully
Creating User object...
User object created: {...}
Inserting user into database...
User inserted with ID: ...
Creating access token...
Access token created successfully
Registration successful, returning response
```

### If It Fails:
The logs will show **exactly** where it fails:
- Database connection issue?
- Password hashing problem?
- User model validation error?
- JWT creation failure?
- Environment variable missing?

**Deploy and check the Render logs for detailed error information!** üîç
