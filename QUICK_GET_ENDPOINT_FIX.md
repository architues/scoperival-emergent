# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix: Added GET Test Endpoint

## Issue
The `/api/test-cors` endpoint was POST-only, but browser testing uses GET requests.

## Fix Applied
âœ… Added **GET version** of test endpoint  
âœ… Kept **POST version** for frontend testing  
âœ… Both return JSON with CORS headers  

## Deploy and Test

### 1. Push the fix:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GET version of test-cors endpoint for browser testing"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Test in browser (GET):
```
https://scoperival-emergent.onrender.com/api/test-cors
```

### 3. Expected response:
```json
{
  "message": "CORS is working!",
  "backend": "connected", 
  "method": "GET",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-15T21:45:00.123456"
}
```

**This should work in browser now!** ðŸš€
